# Sample-Projects-I-tried
50Projects Challenge

In here I tried to create some simple projects to improve my skills as a frontend developer.

Project Structure
Almost every project has three main files. 
1. index.html which is the home page of each project
2. style.css which is the style sheet I have used to style my projects
3. script.js is the JavaScript file of the project.
4. Whenever I needed to add a media to my project, I used a folder called asset to add all of the assets here.

Whenever I felt that I haven't learnt something deep enough, I found another project that helps me to understand the concept that I needed to practice more. I will try to add as much project as I can here so I can enhance my capablity and skillset as a frontend developer.
